## Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Data Scientist, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</span> <span>Jun 2022 -- Present</span>

 - Designed, implemented, and trained a deep learning model to detect spontaneous postsynaptic currents in current-clamp neuronal electrophysiology signals. Trained the model to an F1 score of 81%. My model saves dozens of hours of manual annotation per experiment.
 - Designed, implemented, and trained a deep learning model to forecast behavioral events in laboratory animals, using computer vision and sequence modeling on behavioral neuroscience videos. Published a preprint detailing results.
 - Finetuned and trained from scratch multiple DNA-sequence large language models (LLMs) on the order of 100M-2B parameters using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel. Improved existing LLM architecture's parallelism by 4x.
 - Refactored a torchvision-based medical image analysis pipeline to be hardware-agnostic (GPU & TPU).
 - Led analysis of spatial transcriptomics, single-cell sequencing, whole-brain microscopy, and electrophysiology data.

### <span>Research Data Scientist Intern, Johnson & Johnson</span> <span>Jun 2021 -- Oct 2021</span>

 - Discovered nine digital biomarkers of four autoimmune disorders from wearable sensor data.
 - Implemented distributed pipeline for terabyte-scale accelerometer data. Improved running time > 100x.
 - Implemented signal processing algorithms to detect interpretable sleep and activity patterns in accelerometer data.
 - Trained statistical machine learning models to classify disease vs. healthy controls from interpretable time-series features. Presented all results to project stakeholders.

### <span>Graduate Research Assistant, Research Foundation of CUNY</span> <span>Aug 2020 -- Jun 2022</span>

  - Built machine learning models to predict adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
  - Contributed to data preprocessing, model building, and visualization/analysis that won a national data challenge hosted by the National Institutes of Health: [https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/challenges/decoding-maternal-morbidity](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/challenges/decoding-maternal-morbidity). Wrote multiple technical machine learning preprints documenting the methods and results.
  - Conceptualized, implemented, and validated two novel ensemble learning techniques for handling large amounts of missing data in tabular datasets, with and without imputation.
